# Panopted Classification Toolkit

This repository contains miscellaneous tools for handling
Panoptes classifications from the MoEDAL
Monopole Quest! Panoptes project. 

* `skim-classifications.py`: This script takes the raw classifications
dump file (CSV) and skims it for relevant data.
* `process-skimmed-classifications`: This script processes the skimmed
classification annotations, producing images, plots and data for 
further analysis.
